This is the repository for the many exercises I'll be developing troughout my path on becoming a web developer.

From block 6 module 3 and beyond, the files will be structured this way:

Head file named after the block number (dot) module number. Inside, two folders which are "preparing" for fixation exercises embedded within the course's explanation and "exercise" for exercises after explanation. For example:

ðŸ“¦6.3<br>
 â”£ ðŸ“‚exercise<br>
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œindex.html<br>
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œscript.js<br>
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œstyle.css<br>
 â”— ðŸ“‚preparing<br>
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œindex.html<br>
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œscript.js<br>
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œstyle.css<br>
 
*note that some modules may not have preparing exercises*
